# User Management System - n-Tier ASP.NET Core Project (ONGOING)
This project is a user management-focused application built with ASP.NET Core Web API.
It follows the principles of N-Layer Architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and separation of concerns.
The system provides secure and scalable solutions for core operations such as user registration, login, listing, authorization, and role-based access control.

Technologies and Techniques Used:

- ASP.NET Core Web API for developing RESTful services

- Entity Framework Core with Code First approach

- JWT Authentication and Role-Based Authorization for secure authentication and access control

- DTO (Data Transfer Objects) to optimize and secure data transfer

- Repository Pattern to abstract the data access layer

- AutoMapper for object-to-object mapping

- FluentValidation for powerful and customizable user input validation

- Global Exception Handling for consistent and centralized error management

- Swagger UI and CORS Policy integration

- Clean coding practices, adherence to SOLID principles, and maintainable software architecture

System Features:

- Secure user registration and authentication processes

- JWT Token generation for authenticated users

- Role-based access control: Admin users can manage all users, while department managers can only access their own employees

- Centralized handling of application-wide exceptions with custom error responses

- Validation of incoming data through FluentValidation with detailed error feedback

- Performance and security-oriented system configuration

This project aims to build a modern, secure, and maintainable user management infrastructure suitable for enterprise-level applications.
It demonstrates my capabilities in backend development, layered architecture, error handling, validation mechanisms, and security best practices.
